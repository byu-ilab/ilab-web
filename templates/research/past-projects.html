      <h4><a href={{ url_for("show",directory="research",page="steam-measurements") }}>Steam
	Measurements</a></h4>
      <p>Measuring the Steam network to provide insight into how people play video games.</p>

      <h4><a href={{ url_for("show",directory="research",page="sentiment-analysis") }}>Sentiment Analysis</a></h4>
      <p>Helping to understand political and social change in the Middle East by automatically learning the sentiment of political tweets in Farsi.
      </p>

      <h4><a href={{ url_for("show",directory="research",page="wifu") }}>WiFu</a></h4>
      <p>An open source software toolkit that allows researchers and
	developers to create transport protocols in user space, rather
	than in the Linux Kernel. This is helps us to be able to
	rapidly prototype new transport protocols and to conduct
	realistic experimental evaluations on these protocols, rather
	than relying on simulations.</p>

      <h4><a href={{ url_for("show",directory="research",page="wireless-modeling") }}>Wireless Network Modeling and Mapping</a></h4>
      <p>Mathematical representations of contention and interference
      among nodes. This enables us to develop optimal rate control
      algorithms and also to detect intrusive devices that disrupt
      communication.</p>

      <h4><a href={{ url_for("show",directory="research",page="dynamic-adaptive-streaming-over-http") }}>Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP</a></h4>
      <p>Software and algorithms to improve the performance of
	streaming video over the Internet, particularly when
	connection quality is highly variable.</p>
