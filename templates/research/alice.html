      <p><i>Improving the usability of the authentication ceremony in secure messaging applications</i></p>
      
      <p>Recent disclosures of government surveillance and fears over
      cybersecurity attacks have increased public interest in secure
      and private communication. As a result, numerous secure
      messaging applications have been developed, including Signal,
      WhatsApp, and Viber, which provide end-to-end encryption of
	personal messages.</p>

      <p>Most popular secure messaging applications are usable because
      they hide many of the details of how encryption is
      provided. However, the strength of the security properties of
      these applications rests on the <i>authentication ceremony</i>,
      in which users validate the encryption keys being used.
      Unfortunately, recent studies show that most users do not know
      how to successfully complete this ceremony and are thus
      vulnerable to potential attacks. Any user who does not execute
      the authentication ceremony for a particular conversation is
      essentially trusting the application's servers to correctly
      distribute the encryption keys. This leaves users vulnerable to
	threats that can intercept communications.</p>

      <p>We are studying methods to improve the usability of the
      authentication ceremony, so that it is easy for users to locate
	and complete the ceremony.</p>
