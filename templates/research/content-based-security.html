      The World Wide Web has become the most common platform for
      building applications and delivering content. Yet despite years
      of research, the web continues to face severe security
      challenges related to data integrity and confidentiality. Rather
      than continuing the exploit-and-patch cycle, we propose
      addressing these challenges at an architectural level, by
      supplementing the webâ€™s existing connection-based and
      server-based security models with a new approach: content-based
      security. With this approach, content is directly signed and
      encrypted at rest, enabling it to be delivered via any path and
      then validated by the browser. We are exploring how this new
      architectural approach can be applied to the web and analyzing its
      security benefits.
