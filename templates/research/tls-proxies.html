      <p>Communicating securely over the Internet requires
	authenticating the identity of a website to establish
	trust. Currently the web uses TLS to validate digital
	certificates signed by certificate authorities.
      </p>

      <p>
	This validation system is currently being compromised by the
	use of TLS proxies, which can act as a man-in-the-middle
	(MitM) for TLS connections. A TLS proxy can issue a substitute
	certificate for any site the user visits, so that the user
	establishes an encrypted connection to the proxy rather than
	the desired web site. The proxy can then decrypt and monitor
	or modify all user traffic, before passing it along via a
	second encrypted channel to the desired web site.
      </p>

      <p>
	The use of TLS proxies to intercept encrypted traffic is
	controversial since the same mechanism can be used for both
	benevolent purposes, such as protecting against malware, and
	for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or warrantless
	government surveillance.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	To understand the prevalence and uses of these proxies, we
	have built a TLS proxy measurement tool and deployed it via a
	Google AdWords campaign.</p>

      <p>We have also conducted surveys to understand user attitudes and
	preferences toward the inspection of encrypted traffic.
