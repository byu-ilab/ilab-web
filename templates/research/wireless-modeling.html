      <p>Wireless networks introduce fundamental questions of how
	shared resources are divided among competing
	users. Cooperation between nodes of the network is necessary
	for users to have global access, yet bandwidth limitations
	induce competition. This competitive environment is enticing
	to malicious users, who can then strategically induce network
	conditions to achieve various objectives. Modeling and mapping
	wireless networks poses fundamental challenges that are
	essential for managing competition and protecting against
	intruders.</p>

      <p>We have studied the wireless network modeling problem from
	the perspective of optimal rate control for the users of a
	wireless mesh network. We have developed a model that
	incorporates partial interference that yields a convex
	optimization problem when formulated using link rates, with
	numerical results illustrating significantly higher utilities
	as compared to models that treat interference as
	contention. We have also developed a first-principles model of
	wireless networks based on representing the perceived times
	during which a signal is sent as a random set. We have shown
	that the first-principles model reduces to the classical
	models under certain limiting conditions. Because the
	first-principles model incorporates a more complete model of
	the wireless network, we are able to use it as a benchmark to
	evaluate the performance of other rate controllers that are
	more practical to deploy.</p>

      <p>Our current work explores the problem of mapping a wireless
	network and detecting interfering devices. We are
	demonstrating how it is possible to use the signal structure
	of the network, which is the open-loop causal relationships
	among signals, to represent causal relationships between the
	links in the wireless network. This builds directly on work
	that developed dynamical structure functions to represent
	biological systems whose internal states cannot be completely
	observed. We are developing a protocol that can construct the
	signal structure of a wireless network using perturbation
	experiments. The resulting map can then be used to detect
	intrusive devices that temporarily disrupt communication and
	impair performance.</p>
