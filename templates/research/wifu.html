      </div>
      <p>The research community has invested considerable effort on
	improving TCP performance in wireless networks, but very few
	of these solutions have been evaluated experimentally in a
	wireless network testbed. WiFu makes this easier by allowing
	user-space development of a transport protocol. WiFu uses a
	composable, modular architecture, so that the researcher can
	rapidly plug-and-play with new designs. The toolkit has two
	major pieces: WiFu Transport for end-to-end transport
	functionality and WiFu Core for per-hop interception of
	packets and cross-layer functionality. Currently WiFu has an
	implementation of TCP Tahoe, with additional protocols in
	development.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span4">
	  <p>
	    <span class="label label-success">Flexibility</span>
	    <br>Protocols are built out of components, so it is easy to
	    plug-and-play with new reliability or congestion control
	    protocols
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
	  <p>
	    <span class="label label-success">Code Reuse</span>
	    <br>WiFu comes with event handling, timers,
	    packet formats, and other functionality so you get the
	    convenience of a simulator with the reality of an
	    implementation
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
	  <p>
	    <span class="label label-success">Performance </span>
	    <br>WiFu TCP is as fast as the kernel in wireless
	    networks and on 100 Mbps Ethernet, while having
	    identical fairness among flows
	  </p>
	</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span4">
	  <p>
	    <span class="label label-success">Easy Porting</span>
	    <br>WiFu implements the standard BSD socket API, so it
	    is simple to port any application for use with WiFu
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
	  <p>
	    <span class="label label-success">Network	Debugging</span>
	    <br>WiFu comes with a mock network object and Wireshark
	    packet traces, greatly simplifying the process of
	    debugging a network protocol
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
	  <p>
	    <span class="label label-success">Scalability</span>
	    <br>Support for multiple applications, built with
	    threading, written entirely in C++
	  </p>
